# CustomerService
A Customer Service Windows app.
still in progress.
in this project, I have been trying to implement clean architecture and upgrade my usual interface with the help of XAML and some control packages.
although I am mainly focusing on the coding, I would still prefer the UI to be rather more tasteful and less bland as the dotnetbar controls lack the necessary UI elements I'm hoping to use in this project.
I will update the project as the development goes on.
I am open to suggestions and would also appreciate Fellow devs general Assessments of the project.
With Best Wishes, Amir Hossein Bakhshi.
